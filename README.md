 With the module and challenge we were exposed to many types of graphs and how to display them in a visually appealing way. I had decided to make changes to the intial design of the webpage above and transform the graphs to make this data more visually appealing. 
 
 
 #### Section of the Bar and Bubble

 #### Section of the Guage

 After getting the data to populate in the graphs I was able to then further transform the data so that the graphs would all have the same blue theme to them across the webpage. Through this challenge I have tried to give weight to the data and analytics of this challenge, but also factor in the end user who will want to see an easy to use and visually appealing webpage to get high level information on Belly Button Bio - Diversity. 
 
 
 ## Deliverable 4
 
 In this section I added to the Webpage to give it my own touch. I was not the biggest fan of the original color scheme so I decided to go with something I found more appealing. 
 
 #### Add an image to the jumbotron.
 #### Add background color or a variety of compatible colors to the webpage.
 #### Use a custom font with contrast for the colors
 
 Beyond that I also made sure that the first ID to populate the page is ID 940 and the change in ID affects all 3 charts.
